        "titulo": "Neurochemical Mechanisms at Play",
        "texto": "Advanced studies show that activating Amnesia Type 2 depends on a balanced release of neurotransmitters like dopamine and oxytocin. By combining sensory stimuli—such as a subtle touch, an intense gaze, and a distinctive scent—you trigger a 'reset' in his emotional memories. This process erases old influences, paving the way for new, intense memories where you are the only stimulus."
